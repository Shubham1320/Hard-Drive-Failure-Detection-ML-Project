# Hard-Drive-Failure-Detection-ML-Project
This project uses the Backblaze Dataset about hard-drive failures at a data center collected in 2014. Various Machine Learning Models such as SVM, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier are trained in this project to classify whether a hard-drive will fail or not. Random Forest Classifier gives the best results with highest Area under ROC curve value.
